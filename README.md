# Warehouse Robot with Visual Cognizance

We had to program an Autonomous Ground Vehicle (AGV) to make it capable of autonomously traversing an indoor environment 
to assist moving objects from one place to another. 
The purpose of the bot could be effective as a bot in a warehouse, which could pick up specific objects from one place and put it at another specific location, thus reducing the amount of manpower required.
